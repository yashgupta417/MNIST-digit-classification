# MNIST-digit-classification

 Design a Bayes classifier for classifying the numbers in the MNIST handwritten digit recognition databases 
Dataset link: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ 
(a) Design a classifier to distinguish between 0 and 1. Use the training database available for both to design the classifier. 
(b) Use the testing database to compute the classification accuracy ((TP+TN)/ (TP+TN+FP+FN)) of the Bayesian model. 
(c) Plot the ROC curves between FAR vs GAR. 
(d) Repeat the above three parts for classifying the digits 3 and 8. 
(e) Compare and contrast the results of the two classifiers.
